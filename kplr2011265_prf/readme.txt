This document includes all PRF model image for every module and output. 
If the module is smaller than 10, the prefix is 'kprl0'. If not, the prefix is 'kprl'
And module number is following 'kprl' or 'kprl0'. We use dot as a separation between module number and output number.
e.g : 'kprl04.3_2011265_prf.fits' means the prf model targets towards sources with module 4 and output 3.
